# psmove-vr
A way to play SteamVR games without a real VR headset.

WIP - The project is still in it's early develelopement stage, so here's a list of things that I already did and things that I plan to do:

+ ❗ Controller position and rotation tracking (position done, rotation in progress)
+ ✔ Emulate grip button as the PS Move doesn't have one for some reason
+ ❌ Connection to SteamVR (preferrably by done drivers and FreePIE)
+ ❌ Compatibility for *every* real VR game

What am I doing right now:
- Controller depth
- FreePIE UDP receiver plugin and hydra emulation script, it's almost done!
