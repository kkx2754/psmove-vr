# psmove-vr
A way to play SteamVR games without a real VR headset.

WIP - The project is still in it's early develelopement stage, so here's a list of things that I already did and things that I plan to do:

+ ❌ Controller position and rotation tracking (just changed the idea, so restart of the project is needed)
+ ❌ Emulate grip button as the PS Move doesn't have one for some reason
+ ❌ Connection to SteamVR (preferrably by done drivers and FreePIE)
+ ❌ Compatibility for *every* real VR game

What am I doing right now:
- Absolutely nothing with the tracking because I'm not home and I forgor to take my PS Move controllers with me 💀
- FreePIE UDP receiver plugin and hydra emulation script, it's almost done!
