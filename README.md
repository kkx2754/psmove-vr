A way to play SteamVR games without a real VR headset.

WIP - The project is still in it's early develelopement stage, so here's a list of things that I already did and things that I plan to do:

+ ✔ Hand position and rotation tracking
+ ❌ Emulate buttons using gestures
+ ❌ Connection to SteamVR (preferrably by done drivers and FreePIE)
+ ❌ Compatibility for *every* real VR game
